# Northstar PR Fork #

Hello! This is Emi's PR fork of [panicbit/northstar][1]. The code on display here is
still under review and may be unstable.  If you're interested in using this
project for a project, please checkout the upstream repository, unless you
specifcally want one of the WIP unstable features in development here.

If you are interested in the outstanding PRs, please feel free to  check out the
other branches in this repository, or browse the PRs on the upstream's page.

I also manage a northstar fork called [kochab][2] on my GitLab.  While
northstar aims to be a lightweight and minimal Gemini SDK, kochab is packed
with features like user management, automatic routing, certificate generation,
and the ability to run as an SCGI server instead of a raw gemini server, all
toggleable with feature flags, allowing you to design exactly the library you
need without the added bloat.

Although they started as the same project, it's important to note that kochab
and northstar have signifigantly diverged.  Choose the library that works best
for your project.

Thanks!
